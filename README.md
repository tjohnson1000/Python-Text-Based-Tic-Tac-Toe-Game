# Python Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This project is a simple, interactive implementation of **Tic-Tac-Toe** in Python using a dictionary-based board. Two players alternate turns to place their mark (`X` or `O`) until the board is full. It’s a great exercise in working with **loops, dictionaries, user input**, and game logic.

## Features
- **Dictionary-based board** representation
- **Interactive text input** for moves
- Alternating turns between `X` and `O`
- Basic board rendering using `print()` statements

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to represent game state with a Python dictionary
- Use `for` loops and conditionals to alternate turns
- Accept and validate user input for gameplay
- Learn how to structure simple interactive programs

## Sample Output
```bash
 | | 
-+-+-
 | | 
-+-+-
 | | 
Turn for X. Move on which space?
> top-L
X| | 
-+-+-
 | | 
-+-+-
 | | 
...
```

## Conclusion
This game project is a fun way to reinforce basic Python skills such as **data structures, loops, and control flow**. It’s ideal for beginners looking to build their first interactive program or portfolio game project.
